            <p>The full form of AFCAT stands for Air Force Common Admission Test. Indian Air Force is in charge of administering the test. Each year, in February and August, the test is conducted to select Class-I Officers for Flying and Ground Duties (Technical and Non-Technical). Candidates can apply for the AFCAT whether they are male or female.</p>
            <p>Through the AFCAT exam candidates are recruited in the Indian Air Force for the following branches:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Flying Branch</li>
                <li>Ground Duty Technical Branch</li>
                <li>Ground Duty Non-Technical Branch</li>

        </div>

        <div class="eligibility-title">What is AFCAT Exam Eligibility?</div>
        <div class="eligibility-content">
            <p>The eligibility criteria of the Air Force comprise four main aspects that are mandatory for applicants to fulfill. The four components of AFCAT eligibility are:</p>

            <li>Applications for the exam are accepted by candidates who are in their final semester or year of study. They shouldn’t currently have any backlog. Furthermore, candidates must have gotten a minimum of 60% of the total marks in the previous semester.</li>
            <li>After commissioning, candidates seeking integrated/dual certification and students who have completed an LLB programme may apply for IAF legal responsibilities.</li>
            <li>Candidates should adhere to certain norms and regulations when applying to the AFCAT 2023 exam if they work for any government or government-owned organisations. They need to submit a No-Objection certificate.</li>
            <li>The candidates (both from the government or government-owned industrial division) must present NOC during the AFSB testing. Regardless of whether they are contractual, permanent, or temporary subordinates, the candidates must present this NOC.</li>
            <li>Even after submitting an AFCAT application, the applicants’ candidature may be cancelled if the authority gets a grant withheld from the employer.</li>
            <li>If the employers are unable to provide the NOC for whatever reason, the refusal will be considered in writing and submitted to the AFSB.</li>
